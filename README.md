# Spy-Communication-based-on-RSA-Algorithm
Basically we have two spies who want to communicate with each other however they are under suspicion. Now we have to establish a secure means of communication between the two spies without raising any suspicion.
For this means we have decided on implementing the RSA algorithm. The algorithm says that the mediums who wish to communicate have to have a public key and private key. All you have to know for now is that Private keys are only visible to its respective spu and public key is visible to both spies.
